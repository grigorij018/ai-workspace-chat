# 2026-04-10 Backend/Core

- Added an MWS-backed orchestration layer for OpenWebUI backend with an explicit virtual router model `mws/router`.
- Default OpenAI-compatible backend now falls back to `MWS_BASE_URL` and `MWS_API_KEY` when `OPENAI_*` env vars are unset.
- Implemented capability inference/registry for text, vision, audio, embeddings, and image generation models.
- Added backend orchestrator endpoints for model sync and router decision preview.
- Integrated routing into the existing chat path without replacing the single-chat UX:
  `text -> text llm`, `audio -> asr preprocessing`, `image + question -> vlm`, `draw/generate image -> image generation`, `file -> file qa`, `url -> url parse`, `search/latest/research -> web research`.
- Extended long-term memory records with `kind`, `source`, and `enabled`, plus user memory preferences for opt-in/opt-out.
- Added router smoke tests and verified the changed backend files with `python3 -m compileall`.
